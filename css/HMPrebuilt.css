-- These style rules provide a bit of additional styling to the game which there was not
space to cover in the book.

- The line-height property in the p selector controls the height of each line of text, and is
being set to assist with text legibility.

- The z-index property used in the #gameOverMessage selector controls the 'stacking order' of
elements; in other words, which elements sit in front of other elements when those elements
overlap each other. We're setting it to 100 to make sure the game over message appears in front
of all other game graphics.
