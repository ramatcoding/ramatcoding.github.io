                    browsing, email, photos, video, music, games,
                    and ebooks.

                <p>How did the iPad change the world?
                    Well you see that the biggest advantage 
                    in terms of the iPad was that it made it 
                    possible to pick thing up from the tablet
                    that you had been working on from your iPhone
                    or iMac and this had a big impact on the way 
                    that people began to do business. Apps work on 
                    the iPad the just aren't as good on a iPhone.

                    “If there's going to be a third category of 
                    device it's going to have to be better at
                     these kinds of tasks than a laptop or a 
                     smartphone, otherwise it has no reason 
                     for being,” said Jobs. (Jan 27, 2020)

                    The foundation of Jobs’s iPad pitch was counterintuitive.
                     Most don’t buy a laptop for the heavy office tasks they 
                     were originally designed for. They use it mostly to 
                     communicate. What the world needed was a device that 
                     combined the best of both -- “more intimate than a laptop, 
                     and so much more capable than a smartphone”. A picture of 
                     the iPad dropped nicely into place between the iPhone and the 
                     Macbook.
